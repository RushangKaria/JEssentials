II. Description:
The JEssential Library is an attempt to unify the most useful
libraries in JAVA as well as several new features.

The JEssential Library contains the implementation of the 
algorithms used in the Introduction to Algorithms by
Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein Textbook. This is a huge
collection of 200+ algorithms.

Samples are provided for every class that is implemented.

The source code as well as jars are provided in a non-canonical
format which will be fixed in the next release.

The documentation can be generated using javadoc and broken links will
be fixed in the next release.

Please email bug reports to the authors.

We hope this library can soon have many collaborators
